# Single-cell Genomics Assays

I am a scientist working on single-cell functional genomics screens. As a personal note, I started this page to summarize all the single-cell genomics and relevant technologies. The field is moving very fast and we see new coming out publishing almost every single month. And therefore the goal here is not to create the most comprehensive list for all the published assays, but only focus on the methods that I am actively using or could potentially be useful for my future researches. 

## General Considerations

There are many directions that the field is trying to making progress, including:

1. Sample Multiplexing
2. Higher Throughput
3. Multiple Modality
4. Easier sample preparation / storage
5. Perturbations Introduction
6. Lineage Tracing
