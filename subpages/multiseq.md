# MULTI-seq

A technology to use lipid modified oligos to label cells with different conditions. The original MULTI-seq paper uses both long chain lipid modified oligos (LMO) and cholesterol modified oligos (CMO).

## Features

### Pros

- Compatible with any oligo-dT based 3' capturing methods.
- Ease of doing.
- Very affordable price, with CMO synthesized by IDT the cost is only ~$0.20 per staining.
- Barcodes are fully customizable and therefore unlimited numbers of samples can be multiplexed.

### Cons

- LMO is not commercially available.
- Labeling is not thermostable.
- Not compatible with fixed samples (cholesterol or lipid update might be limited).
