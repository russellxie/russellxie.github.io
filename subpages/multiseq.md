# MULTI-seq

A technology to use lipid modified oligos to label cells with different conditions. The original MULTI-seq paper uses both long chain lipid modified oligos (LMO) and cholesterol modified oligos (CMO).

## Features

### Pros

- Compatible with a wide variety of methods, including any poly-dT based scRNA-seq pipeline and 10X feature barcoding / 5'scRNA-seq workflow.
- Ease of doing.
- Antibody staining is very stable, and can survive FACS sorting of the cells.
- Commercially available through BioLegend.

### Cons

- Price is relatively high (~$20 per staining) compared with MULTI-seq; but chaper than 10X Cellplex.
- *In situ* labeling is yet to be tested, have to dissociate the samples into single cell suspension first.
- Limited numbers of barcodes commercially available (only 14).
- Customization of barcode is not easy (need customized antibody conjugation).
